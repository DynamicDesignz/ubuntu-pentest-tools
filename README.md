ubuntu-pentest-tools
====================

Script to install security tools, and other Ubuntu goodies.

Supports Ubuntu 17.04 Gnome. For older releases please try, but it might not be supported. I have decided to support Ubuntu-Gnome as Unity will be phased out based on Canonical's decision and the script will reflect this.

You can get Ubuntu Gnome here https://ubuntugnome.org/

Use the ubuntu-pentest-tool-17.04.sh script.

*Any suggestions to add more tools, or else, please don't hesitate to contact me.*
*Will be maintained to the best of my ability.*

**How to use this script:**

- chmod +x ubuntu-pentest-tools-XX-XX.sh then sudo ./ubuntu-pentest-tools-XX-XX.sh 

Thanks to everyone that helps make this script better.

Note : Thanks for the people who reports issues with files or missing programs in folders, it's really appreciated. Also, for the people who forks the script, please note that it changes quite frequently, so you should always keep the original :) 

Requirements
====================
About 20-30gb of disk space, and the latest ubuntu.
